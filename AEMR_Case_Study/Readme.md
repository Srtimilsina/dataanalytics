The American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) is the United States of America’s domestic energy network. The regulator’s responsibility is to ensure America’s energy network remains reliable with minimal disruptions(outages). There are four key types of outages:

● Consequential

● Forced

● Opportunistic

● Planned

In 2016 and 2017, the AEMR management team was aware of high outages. The management team has expressed a desire to have the following two areas of concern addressed:

A) Energy Stability and Market Outages

B) Energy Losses and Market Reliability

As an analyst within the data and reporting team, you have been asked to address these two immediate areas of concern. Feel free to also explore beyond the queries asked and provide additional insights that you feel may be of interest to the management team.
