Part I. Energy Stability & Market Outages

Energy stability is one of the key themes the AEMR management team cares about. To ensure energy security and reliability, AEMR needs to understand the following:
What are the most common outage types and how long do they tend to last?
How frequently do the outages occur?
Are there any energy providers which have more outages than their peers which may be indicative of being unreliable?

1.To perform the analysis,we do the COUNT the number of valid (i.e. Status = Approved) Outage Events sorted by their respective Outage_Reason (i.e. Forced, Consequential, Scheduled, Opportunistic) over the 2016 & 2017 Periods. This is done to see the trends of specific outages over the 2016 and 2017 period.
